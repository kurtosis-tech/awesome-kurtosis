Awesome Kurtosis [![Awesome](https://awesome.re/badge.svg)](https://awesome.re)
===============================================================================

A curated list of [Kurtosis Packages](https://docs.kurtosis.com/concepts-reference/packages) written in [Starlark](https://docs.kurtosis.com/concepts-reference/starlark).

These packages provide a starting point for understanding how to setup, test, and manage different types of environments using the [Kurtosis CLI](https://docs.kurtosis.com/install).

You can run any of these examples without installing anything in [the Kurtosis Playground](https://gitpod.io/#/https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/playground-gitpod). Simply open the playground and run the following (swapping `redis-voting-app` with the subdirectory of the example you want):

```bash
kurtosis run github.com/kurtosis-tech/awesome-kurtosis/redis-voting-app
```

### Kurtosis Web2 Starlark Packages

- [Auto-GPT Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/autogpt-package) - installs and starts AutoGPT locally with just 2 commands and with the memory backend of your choice. It's like AutoGPT got `brew install`. Built to simplify the install instructions of the popular open-source attempt to make GPT-4 fully autonomous: [Auto-GPT](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas/Auto-GPT) by [Significant Gravitas](https://github.com/Significant-Gravitas).
- [Cassandra Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/cassandra-package) - spins up an n node Cassandra cluster and verifies that the cluster that was spun up was healthy
- [Redis Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/redis-package) - spins up a Redis instance
- [Etcd Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/etcd-package) - spins up a Etcd instance - authored by [@laurentluce](https://github.com/laurentluce)
- [RabbitMq Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/rabbitmq-package) - spins up a RabbitMQ instance - authored by [@laurentluce](https://github.com/laurentluce)
- [Datastore Army Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/datastore-army-package) - spins up an n node Datastore server cluster
- [MongoDB](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/mongodb-package/) - spins up a MongoDB database
- [Postgres](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/postgres-package) - spins up a local Postgres database
- [Keycloak](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/keycloak-package) - spins up a local Keycloak server with a preconfigured application.
- [Novu](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/novu-package) - spins up a full Novu environment
 
### Kurtosis Web3 Starlark Packages

- [Ethereum Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/eth2-package) - spins up a local Proof-of-Stake (PoS) Ethereum testnet, supporting supporting 9 different EL and CL clients including geth, lighthouse, lodestar, nimbus and erigon.
- [Avalanche Node Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/avalanche-package) - spins up a local, non-staking [Avalanche Go](https://github.com/ava-labs/avalanchego) node for local development and testing. This package can also be used to connect to other containerized services that make up your distributed system, like an instance of a wallet, indexer, explorer, or your dApp.
- [Aptos Validator Node](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/aptos-package/tree/main/testnet-validator-example) - sets up a local Aptos validator node and a testnet faucet for use in local development and testing workflows on the Aptos protocol.
- [NEAR Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/near-package) - spins up a local NEAR testnet with a local RPC endpoint, a NEAR explorer, an indexer for the explorer, and a NEAR wallet.
- [Chainlink Node Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/awesome-kurtosis/tree/main/chainlink-node#chainlink-node) - instantiates a local Chainlink node for development and prototyping against Decentralized Oracle Networks (DONs). Includes the ability to optionally connect to a local multi-client Ethereum testnet, based off of the Ethereum Foundation's [Ethereum Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/eth2-package). Inspiration comes from the original [Chainlink Node docs](https://docs.chain.link/chainlink-nodes/v1/running-a-chainlink-node).

### Tests and other examples

- [Quick Start](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/awesome-kurtosis/tree/main/quickstart) - The example used in the [Quickstart guide](https://docs.kurtosis.com/quickstart) to get started with Kurtosis.
- [Simple NodeJS API](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/awesome-kurtosis/tree/main/simple-api) - An example of how a Simple NodeJS based API can be setup to test using Kurtosis
- [Data Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/awesome-kurtosis/tree/main/data-package) - An example package that contains a tar that you can import and use within the Quickstart and other packages
- [Redis Voting App](./redis-voting-app) - An example package highlighting composition in Kurtosis that uses the [redis-package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/redis-package) and [Azure Voting Front](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/azure-voting-app-redis/tree/master/azure-vote) to spin up a voting app backed by Redis.
- [Flink-Kafka Package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/awesome-kurtosis/tree/main/flink-kafka-example) - An example of integrating a Flink job with Kafka, composed using the [Flink package](https://github.com/kurtosis-tech/flink-package)
